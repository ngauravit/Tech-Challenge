**CHALLENGE 1**

In the first challenge we are deploying a 3-tier web application on Kubernetes cluster.
We have created a Linux VM **"K8sDemo"** where we will be keeping all our deployment file and on the same server we have docker as well as kubectl installed.


**CHALLENGE 2**

In this, we are fetching metadata for any resource using PowerShell script.
We have created Windows VM on Azure **"K8sDemoWin"** and we will be running our script there.


**CHALLENGE 3**

In this challenge, we will be passing a nested object and a key and will output the value using PowerShell function.
We will use the same windows VM **"K8sDemoWin"** created in challenge 2 to run our script.
