# Challenge2

We will be querying meta data of an instance. 
To achieve this task we will be creating an Azure VM and will be running the powershell script **MetaData.ps1**.

We will be inputing the name of the resource and the script will fetch the metadata of the resource and show it as an output.


**EXAMPLES**

Once prompted for the resource name, we should provide the resource for which we want the metadata for:

1. For instance, we will pass "/instance"
2. For compute, we will pass user input as "/input/compute"
